## Intro: Illegal Art

Chicago has historically had a plethora of artist-run gallery spaces[1]. In today's Chicago, the hardest part of running a gallery isn't publicity, it isn't finding talent, but often maintaining legality. Operating a legal gallery event space can cost a prohibitively large amount of money, especially when galleries try to support themselves by selling alcohol at their events. Because of this, artist-run gallery spaces are, for the most part, technically illegal ventures. In order to avoid legal drama, gallery managers try to act as legit as possible and try to avoid attention. Because of this, Chicago's artist-gallerists tend to have a healthy fear of the press. 

One gallerist I spoke to believes that there's no possible benefit to publicity: because the gallery targets a niche, anyone sufficiently interested in that niche to attend an event already knows about the space, therefore it's not valuable to try to gain exposure to a larger audience. Another long-time gallerist went so far as to say that they owe their long-term succes in large part to the fact that they've never appeared in a major publication or directory. To me, this seems preposterous. Perhaps because I am a product of the internet-influenced worldview that a niche market can achieve an audience by producing high-quality content, engaging with fans, and marketing effectively.

Because of these difficulties, mounting above and beyond the inherent difficulties of operating a successful small business, and certainly not reduced by Chicago's unusually large population of transient student artists, a huge majority of Chicago's artist-run spaces are only active for a few years. Only a tiny few have been around for a long time.

## the problem

Maybe I'm young and naive, but I believe the internet has created a lot of passive fans. People who are interested in a thing (art, in this case) but come from outside the community in which that thing is made // displayed // experienced. Imagine an online art fan with no personal ties into the Gallery Scene. Multiple gallery owners told me I'm delusional, but I believe it's possible (and desirable) to convert these passive fans -- to lure them to real-life events. I believe many art students share my view, but one more traditionally established gallery operator implied that this art-student-view is more of a nuisance than anything: held by uncommitted short-term gallerists, but against the interests of the Serious Gallery Scene.

As one of these uncommitted short-term gallerists, I believe that there's tons of room for improved online accessibility / marketing to bring value and exposure to young artists and to small-scale, d.i.y. art events. I'm creating an online directory, a la The Visualist[2]. I'll go more specifically into the differences later, but the main differentiator is that The Visualist relies on gallery runners to submit their events via email, my directory uses an extensible web scraping system to automatically update itself with new events from gallery websites, calendars, and Facebook pages. Additionally, it allows gallery operators, artists, and fans to add events to the directory using a standard API.

Because of the established mindset I discussed earlier, which I can only see as entrenched cynicism, several of the gallerists I spoke to felt that an open directory--where an event might be added whether or not the gallery wanted it to be--was not in the best interest of the art community. One quite-well-established anonymous gallery operator went so far as to say that I would "destroy the art world"
