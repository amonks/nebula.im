<h2>Intro (the problem)</h2>

<p>From museums to apartment galleries, Chicago is <strong>crammed</strong> full of venues for art.</p>

<p>The problem is, it can be hard to know what&#39;s going on. The larger commercial galleries have the resources to publicize their events // openings, but many smaller apartment galleries only list their events on a facebook page or gallery website. With informal galleries popping up, it&#39;s nearly impossible to keep track of it all.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Events database! (the solution)</h2>

<p>I want to make a public directory of art events in Chicago. There needs to be a single unified listing of small art events. This will benefit everyone: it&#39;ll be easier for patrons to discover shows / work, it&#39;ll be easier for artists to artists to keep track of a large and integrated community, and it&#39;ll be easier for galleries to get people in the door.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>goals</h2>

<p>I plan to accomplish this by creating and populating a database of events//galleries with a robust RESTful API. Think Songkick but for art.</p>

<p>Once the database and API exist, I (or anyone else) will be able to develop apps to distribute // harness the data.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>structure</h2>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/S0zA/IMG_2878.JPG" alt="Schematic Jawn" style="width: 80%;" /></p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>steps (detail)</h2>

<p>I&#39;ll develop three main software components:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Framework: Database // API</p></li>
<li><p>Input: Scrapers // Workers</p></li>
<li><p>Output: Calendar app</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get <em>too</em> pedantic, so I&#39;ll briefly outline my plans for execution.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>db - PG (heroku)</h2>

<p>My first step is to set up the database//schema itself. While I&#39;m tempted by a trendy nosql solution, I think the most economical move is to go with a free Postgres instance hosted by Heroku. Since (at least for now) I&#39;ll be the only person <em>writing</em> to the database, and my needs in terms of row count are pretty light, I don&#39;t anticipate reaching the limits of the free plan in the near future.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>API - Sinatra//Rack (heroku)</h2>

<p>I&#39;m going to write the API itself using Sinatra. I&#39;d take the opportunity to get more familiar with node.js, but since the huge majority of the effort required by this project will be in the data acquisition I&#39;d rather stick with a tool I can already execute quickly//reliably with and save myself some time.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Workers</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s the fun part. I expect that almost all event data will exist in one of three formats:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>.ics</p></li>
<li><p>FB events / page</p></li>
<li><p>Unstructured data on gallery website / blog</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll write workers to gather data from all three. I&#39;ll start with .ics because even though it&#39;s probably the least common among galleries, the high degree of structure means a single parser will work unaltered for any gallery that uses the format. Facebook events will be a bit harder to generalize, so I&#39;ll do that next. Since I&#39;ll have to make a custom parser for each gallery, I&#39;ll deal with unstructured data last.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>App // Calendar Output</h2>

<p>Once the database is populated, I&#39;ll make a simple app to display the data in the browser. I doubt I&#39;ll get to it for this class, but at some point I might make a mobile app too. In the meantime I&#39;ll settle for a minimal responsive html jawn.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Admin app for gallerists/curators/artists</h2>

<p>I&#39;d like to plan around the idea that this database could eventually be scaled outside chicago // nationally. Problem is, writing per-gallery parsers isn&#39;t really scalable without pretty major funding. If/when the database becomes popular, I might make another app that gallerists/curators/artists/etc can use to add their own crap to the database. </p>

<p>I want to hold off until this is neccessary because first, opening up db-write access like that creates a plethora of potential headaches (fact checking, security, moderation), and second, because I don&#39;t really anticipate anyone going through effort to add data to an unused databaseâ€¦</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Resources // docs</h2>

<p>This is kinda a separate project, but I feel I should mention it. I&#39;d also like to create resources//documentation to help budding apartment gallerists set themselves up. I want to cull from my own personal experience having shows at my house, and put up some open docs about common pitfalls / advice / helpful shit. I feel like the calendar website might be a good place to put this.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Doc approach</h2>

<p>I want to put together a December show at Greeenha.u$. I want to document the whole process of putting it together, opening up everything from the submission process to show logistics to art decisions, to hanging techniques. </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Theme</h2>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% concrete on this yet, but my initial thought is that the show should focus on networks. I&#39;d like to primarily inlclude art pieces that involve some kind of connectivity / networks in some way.</p>
